<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> In
1989, Michael
Abrash completed *the* classic work on 8088-oriented code
optimization. ZEN OF ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE was published by Scott,
Foresman &amp; Company as part of a series of assembly books edited
by Jeff Duntemann. Unfortunately, not long after the book was
published, Scott, Foresman was acquired by Harper Collins, and the
larger firm chose not to continue the Scott, Foresman computer trade
line. 200 books perished in the acquisition, and while the world was
better off without most of them, ZEN OF ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE vanished
as well.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> In
the intervening
years, since quantities of the book in stores were exhausted, many
people have asked for reprints of ZEN OF ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE. The
economies of publishing do not allow it to be reprinted in its
original form, but Michael has arranged to make the book available as
a set of word processor files on the CD-ROM for the second edition of
ZEN OF GRAPHICS PROGRAMMING.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
There was insufficient
time to include scanned bitmaps of the many figures in ZEN OF
ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE on this first pressing of the CD-ROM, but the
figures will be available on the Coriolis Web Site:
<a class="western" href="http://www.coriolis.com">http://www.coriolis.com</a>,
under book diskette files. Alternately, you can locate the files
through ftp from directory <a class="western" href="ftp://coriolis.com/pub/bookdisk/">ftp://coriolis.com/pub/bookdisk/</a>
in several files in the form ZOAFIG??.ZIP, where ?? will be a
two-digit number representing the chapter from which the figures were
taken. If a chapter is not represented it means that that chapter
contained no figures.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
Future pressings of
the CD-ROM will contain all of the figure bitmap files as well as the
text.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#ff0000"><b>***The
web sites at the above URLs do not function now but there were
some .tif versions on the CD. The figures were poor quality scans </b></font><font color="#ff0000"><u><b>so
we redrew them</b></u></font><font color="#ff0000"><b>
for this version. A few figures were missing so we recreated
them.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> The
text files are in
two formats on the CD-ROM. One, in the WP42 subdirectory of ZOA, is
the Word Perfect 4.2 format, which is still readily importable to
many major word processors. The other is RTF, in the RTF
subdirectory of ZOA, which is the Rich Text Format, which is easily
importable by Microsoft Word and most newer word processors.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> All
of the chapters
are present except for Chapter 6, which has become lost. Chapter 6
simply contains an overview of the 8088 processor, which can be had
in other older books on PC assembly language. Michael did not get
into any of his trademark Zen insights in Chapter 6. It was
presented strictly as foundation knowledge.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> The
code listings for
the book are contained in a self-extracting archive file
ZEN_LIST.EXE. Copy this file to a subdirectory and execute it. The
listing files will be extracted into the subdirectory. </p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#ff0000"><b>***We
transferred the RTF files to MS Word 2007, reformatted some parts,

21+ year old book, and the efforts made to create this electronic
version
might be considered a waste of time. Having written assembly
code during the era of this book and being inspired by it, were
reasons enough to exert the effort. It is unfortunate that Michael
was unable to produce the other planned volume; it might have proved
to be one of the fundamental sources of assembly language programming
techniques.</b></font></p>
