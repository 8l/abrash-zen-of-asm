<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">With this chapter we
start our exploration of the 8088's instruction set. What better
place to begin than with the roots of that instruction set, which
trace all the way back to the dawn of the microcomputer age?</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> If
you're a veteran
programmer, you probably remember the years Before IBM, when
state-of-the-art micros were built around the 8-bit 8080 processor
and its derivatives. In today's era of ever-mightier 16-and 32-bit
processors, you no doubt think you've seen the last of the venerable
but not particularly powerful 8080.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> Not
a chance.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> The
8080 lingers on in
the instruction set and architecture of the 8088, which was designed
with an eye toward making it easy to port 8080 programs to the 8088.
While it may seem strange that the design of an advanced processor
would be influenced by the architecture of a less-capable processor,
that practice is actually quite common and makes excellent market
sense. For example, the 80286 and 80386 processors provide complete
8088 compatibility, and would certainly not have been as successful
were they not 8088-compatible. In fact, one of the great virtues of
the 80386 is its ability to emulate several 8088s at once, and it is
well known that the designers of the 80386 went to considerable
trouble to maintain that link with the past.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">Less well known,
perhaps, is the degree to which the designers of the 8088 were guided
by the past as well. (Actually, as discussed in Chapter 3, the 8086
was designed first and the 8088 spun off from it, but we'll refer
simply to the 8088 from now on, since that's our focus and since the
two processors share the same instruction set.)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"><br>

THE 8080 LEGACY</b></font></a></font></font></h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> At
the time the 8088
was designed, the Intel 8080, an 8-bit processor, was an industry
standard, along with the more powerful but 8080-compatible Zilog Z80
and Intel 8085 chips. The 8080 had spawned CP/M, a widely-used
operating system, and with it a variety of useful programs, including
word processing, spreadsheet, and database software.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> New
processors are
<i>always</i> &#8212; without fail &#8212; more powerful than their
predecessors. Nonetheless, processors that lack compatibility with
any previous generation are generally not widely used for several
years &#8212; if ever &#8212; because software developers don't come
fully up to speed on new processors for several years, and it's a
broad software base that makes a processor useful and therefore
popular. In the interim, relatively few programs are available to
run on that processor, and sales languish. One solution to this
problem is to provide complete compatibility with an earlier
standard, as the Z80 and 8085 did. Indeed, today the NEC V20
processor, which is fully 8088 compatible, has the equivalent of an
8080 built in, and can readily switch between 8088-and
8080-compatible modes.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">Unfortunately, chip
space was at a premium during the 1970s, and presumably Intel
couldn't afford to put both 8088 and 8080 functionality into a single
package. What Intel could and did do was design the 8088 so that it
would be relatively easy to port 8080 programs &#8212; especially
assembler programs, since most programs were written in assembler in
those days &#8212; to run on the 8088, and so that those ported
programs would perform reasonably well.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> The
designers of the
8088 provided such "source-level" compatibility by making
the 8088's register set similar to the 8080's, by implementing
directly analogous &#8212; although not identical &#8212; 8088
instructions for most 8080 instructions and by providing special
speedy, compact forms of key 8080 instructions. As a result, the
8088's architecture bears a striking similarity to that of the 8080.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> For
example, the
8088's 16-bit AX, BX, CX, and DX registers can also be accessed as
paired 8-bit registers, thereby making it possible for the 8088 to
mimic the seven 8-bit program-accessible registers and the 8-bit
FLAGS register of the 8080, as shown in Figure 8.1. In particular,
the 8088's BH and BL registers can be used together as the BX
register to address memory, just as the 8080's HL register pair can.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"><img src="ZOA_html_32d1f046.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" height="743" width="625"></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> The
register
correspondence between the 8080 and 8088 is not perfect. For one
thing, neither CX nor DX can be used to address memory as the 8080's
BC and DE register pairs can; however, the 8088's <b>xchg</b>
instruction and/or index registers can readily be used to compensate
for this. Similarly, the 8080 can push both the flags and the
accumulator onto the stack with a single instruction, while the 8088
cannot. As we'll see later in this chapter, though, the designers of
the 8088 provided two instructions &#8212; <b>lahf</b> and <b>sahf</b>
&#8212; to take care of that very problem.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> All
in all, while the
8080 and 8088 certainly aren't brothers, they're close relatives
indeed.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"><br>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> In
general, the 8088's
instruction set reflects the influence of the 8080 fairly strongly.
While the 8088's instruction set is a considerable superset of the
8080's, there are few 8080 instructions that can't be emulated by one
(or at most two) 8088 instructions, and there are several 8088
instructions that most likely would not exist were it not for the
8080 legacy. Also, although it's only speculation, it certainly
seems possible that the segmented memory architecture of the 8088 is
at least partially the result of needing to reconcile the 1 Mb
address space of the 8088 with the 8-and 16-bit nature of the
registers the 8088 inherited from the 8080. (Segmentation does allow
some types of code to be more compact than it would be if the 8088
had an unsegmented address space, so let's not blame segmentation
entirely on the 8080.)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> The
8088 is without
question a more powerful processor than the 8080, with far more
flexible addressing modes and register usage, but it is nonetheless
merely a 16-bit extension of the 8080 in many ways, rather than a
processor designed from scratch. We can only speculate as to what the
capabilities of an 8088 built without regard for the 8080 might have
been &#8212; but a glance at the 68000's 16 Mb linear address space
and large 32-bit register set gives us a glimpse of that future that
never was.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> At
any rate, the 8088
<i>was</i> designed with the 8080 in mind, and the
orientation of the
8088's instruction set toward porting 8080 programs seems to have
served its purpose. Many 8080 programs, including WordStar and
VisiCalc, were ported to the 8088, and those ported programs helped
generate the critical mass of software that catapulted the 8088 to a
position of dominance in the microcomputer world. How much of the
early success of the 8088 was due to ported 8080 software and how
much resulted from the letters "IBM" on the nameplate of
the PC is arguable, but ported 8080 software certainly sold well for
some time.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">Today the need for
8080 source-level compatibility is long gone, but that 8080-oriented
instruction set is with us still, and seems likely to survive well
into the 21st century in the silicon of the 80386 and its successors.
(Amazingly, every processor shown in Figure 3-5 provides full 8088
compatibility, and it's a safe bet that future generations will be
compatible as well. In fact, although it hasn't happened as of this
writing, it appears that some <i>non-Intel</i>
manufacturers may
build 8088-compatible subprocessors into their chips!)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> The
8080 flavor of the
8088's instruction set is both a curse and a blessing. It's a curse
because it limits the performance of average 8088 code, and a
blessing because it provides great opportunity for assembler code to
shine. In particular, the 8080-specific instructions occupy valuable
space in the 8088 opcode set &#8212; arguably causing native 8088
code (as opposed to ported 8080 code) to be larger and slower than it
would otherwise be &#8212; and that is, by-and-large, one of the less
appealing aspects of the 8088. For the assembler programmer,
however, the 8080-specific instructions can be an asset. Since those
instructions are faster and more compact than their general-purpose
counterparts, they can often be used to create significantly better
code. Next, we'll examine the 8080-specific instructions in detail.</font></font></p>

ACCUMULATOR-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS</b></font></a></font></font></h2>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> The
accumulator is a
rather special register on the 8080. For one thing, the 8080 requires
that the accumulator be the destination for most arithmetic and
logical operations. For another, the accumulator is the register
generally used as source and destination for memory accesses that use
direct addressing. (Refer back to Chapter 7 for a discussion of
addressing modes.)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> Not
so with the 8088. In the 8088's instruction set, the accumulator (AL
for 8-bit
operations, AX for 16-bit operations) is a special register for some
operations, such as multiplication and division, but is by-and-large
no different from any other general-purpose register. With the 8088,
any of the eight general-purpose registers can be the source or
destination for logical operations, addition, subtraction, and memory
accesses as readily as the accumulator can.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">While the 8088's
instructions are far more flexible than the 8080's instructions, that
flexibility has a price. The price is an extra instruction byte, the
<i>mod-reg-rm</i> byte, which encodes the 8088's many
addressing
modes and source/destination combinations, as we learned in Chapter
7. Thanks to the <i>mod-reg-rm</i> byte, 8088 instructions
are
normally 1 byte longer than equivalent 8080 instructions. However,
several 8080-inspired 8088 instructions, which require that the
accumulator be one of the operands and accept only a few
possibilities for the other operand, are the same length as their
8080 counterparts. (Not all the special instructions have exact 8080
counterparts, but that doesn't make them any less useful.) While
these accumulator-specific instructions lack the flexibility of their
native 8088 counterparts, they are also smaller and faster, so it's
desirable to use them whenever possible.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> The
accumulator-specific 8088 instructions fall into two categories:
instructions involving direct addressing of memory, and instructions
involving immediate arithmetic and logical operands. We'll look at
accumulator-specific memory accesses first.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"><br>

DIRECT-ADDRESSING INSTRUCTIONS</b></font></a></font></font></h3>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> The
8088 lets you
address memory operands in a great many different ways &#8212; 16
ways, to be precise, as we saw in Chapter 7. This flexibility is one
of the strengths of the 8088, and is one way in which the 8088 far
exceeds the 8080. There's a price for that flexibility, though, and
that's the <i>mod-reg-rm</i> byte, which we encountered in
Chapter 7. To briefly recap, the <i>mod-reg-rm</i> byte is
a second instruction
byte, immediately following the opcode byte of most instructions that
access memory, which specifies which of 32 possible addressing modes
are to be used to select the source and/or destination for the
instruction. (8 of the addressing modes are used to select the 8
general-purpose registers as operands, and 8 addressing modes differ
only in the size of the displacement field, hence the discrepancy
between the 32 addressing modes and the 16 ways to address memory
operands.) Together, the <i>mod-reg-rm</i> byte and the
16-bit
displacement required for direct addressing mean that any instruction
that uses <i>mod-reg-rm</i> direct addressing must be at
least 4
bytes long, as shown in Figure 8.2.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"><img src="ZOA_html_6d88b005.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" height="312" width="630"></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">Direct addressing is
used whenever you simply want to refer to a memory location by name,
with no pointing or indexing. For example, a counter named <b>Count</b>
could be incremented with direct addressing as follows:</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in; margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 40px;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"><font color="#890000"><b> inc [Count]</b></font></font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"><br>
</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">Direct
addressing is
intuitive and convenient, and is one of the most heavily used
addressing modes of the 8088.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">Since direct
addressing is one of the very few addressing modes of the 8080, and
since the 8088's designers needed to make sure that ported 8080 code
ran reasonably well on the 8088, there are 8088 instructions that do
nothing more than load and store the accumulator from and to memory
via direct addressing. These instructions are only 3 bytes long, as
shown in Figure 8.3; better yet, they execute in just 10 cycles,
rather than the 14 (memory read) or 15 (memory write) cycles required
by <i>mod-reg-rm</i> memory accesses that use direct
addressing. (Those cycle counts are for byte-sized accesses; add 4
cycles to both
forms of <b>mov</b> for word-sized accesses.)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"><img src="ZOA_html_m65d340d6.jpg" align="bottom" border="0" height="358" width="644"></font></font></p>

odd aspect of the

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> The
implications of
accumulator-specific direct addressing are obvious: whenever you
need to read or write a direct-addressed memory operand, do so via
the accumulator if at all possible. You can take this a step further
by running unorthodox applications of accumulator-specific direct
addressing through the Zen timer to see whether they're worth using.
For example, one common use of direct addressing is checking whether
a flag or count is zero, with an instruction sequence like:</font></font></p>

accumulator-specific direct addressing can help speed things up a

through the Zen timer. The Zen timer reports that the
accumulator-specific means of testing a memory location and setting
the appropriate zero/non-zero status executes in 6.34 us per test,
more than 6% faster than the 6.76 us time per test of the standard
test-for-zero code. While 6% isn't a vast improvement, it <i>is</i>
an improvement, and that boost in performance comes at no cost in
code size. In addition, the accumulator-specific form leaves the
variable's value available in the accumulator after the test is
completed, allowing for faster code yet if you need to manipulate or
test that value further. The flip side is that the
accumulator-specific direct-addressing approach <i>requires</i>
that
the test value be loaded into the accumulator, so if you've got
something stored in the accumulator that you don't want to lose, by
all means use the <i>mod-reg-rm</i> <b>cmp</b>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">There are two <i>caveats</i>
regarding accumulator-specific immediate-addressing instructions.
First, unlike the accumulator-specific form of the direct-addressing
<b>mov</b> instruction, the accumulator-specific
immediate-addressing
instructions can't work with memory operands. For instance, <b>add
al,[Temp]</b> assembles to a <i>mod-reg-rm</i>
instruction, not to an
accumulator-specific instruction.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">Second, there's no
advantage to using the accumulator-specific immediate-addressing
instructions when they're used with word-sized immediate operands in
the range -128 to +127 (inclusive), although there's no disadvantage,
either. This is true because the word-sized <i>mod-reg-rm</i>
equivalents of the accumulator-specific instructions can store
immediate values in this range as bytes and then sign-extend them to
words at execution time, while the accumulator-specific
immediate-addressing instructions cannot, as shown in Figure 8.10.
Consequently, both forms of these instructions are 3 bytes long when
used with immediate operands in the range -128 to +127. </font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> An
important note: some 8088 references indicate that while immediate
operands to
arithmetic instructions can be sign-extended, immediate operands to
logical instructions &#8212; <b>xor</b>, <b>and</b>,
and <b>or</b> &#8212;
cannot. Not true! Immediate operands to logical instructions <i>can</i>
be sign-extended, and MASM does so automatically whenever possible.</font></font></p>

interchanging AX (not AL) with any of the 8 general-purpose

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">so
the AX-specific form
of <b>xchg</b> can be an attractive alternative to <b>mov</b>
when
you don't require that the copied value remain in the source register
after the copy. </font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">When else might the
AX-specific version of <b>xchg</b> be useful? Suppose that
we've got
a loop in which we need to add together elements from two arrays,
subtract from that sum a value from a third array, and store the
result in a fourth array. Suppose further that we can't use BP,
perhaps because it's dedicated to maintaining a stack frame. What's
more, the pointers to the arrays are passed in, so we can't just use
one pointer register as an array subscript by way of
displacement+base addressing. Now we've got a bit of a problem: there
are only three registers other than BP capable of addressing
memory, but we need pointers to four arrays. We could, of course,
load two or more of the pointers from memory each time through the
loop, but that would slow processing considerably. We could also
store two of the pointers in other registers and copy them into, say,
BX as we need them, but that would require us to use three registers
to maintain two pointers, and, as it happens, we don't have a
register to spare.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> The
solution is to
keep one pointer in BX and one in AX, and swap them as needed via the
AX-specific form of <b>xchg</b>. (As usual, the assembler
automatically uses the most efficient possible form of <b>xchg</b>;
you don't have to worry about explicitly selecting it.) <a name="L812R"></a><a class="western" href="#L812">Listing
8-12</a> show an implementation that uses the AX-specific form of
<b>xchg</b> to handle our four-array case without accessing
memory or
using BP.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> <a class="western" href="#L812">Listing
8-12</a> is intentionally constructed to allow us to use the
AX-specific form of <b>xchg</b>. It's natural to choose
AL, not DL,
as the register used for adding and moving data, but if we had done
that, then the <b>xchg</b> would have become <b>xchg
dx,bx</b>, which
is the 2-byte <i>mod-reg-rm</i> version. <a name="L813R"></a><a class="western" href="#L813">Listing
8-13</a> shows this less-efficient version of <a class="western" href="#L812">Listing
8-12</a>. Thanks solely to the AX-specific form of <b>xchg</b>,
<a class="western" href="#L812">Listing 8-12</a>
executes in 21.12 us
per array element, 7% faster than the 22.63 us per array element of
<a class="western" href="#L813">Listing 8-13</a>.
(By the way, we
could revamp <a class="western" href="#L813">Listing
8-13</a> to run
considerably faster by using the <b>lodsb</b> and <b>stosb</b>
string
instructions, but for the moment we're focusing on the AX-specific
form of <b>xchg</b>. Nonetheless, there's a lesson here:
be careful
not to become fixated on a particular trick to the point where you
miss other and possibly better approaches.)</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> The
important point is
that in 8088 assembler it often matters which registers and/or which
forms of various instructions you select. Two seemingly similar code
sequences, such as <a class="western" href="#L812">Listings
8-12</a>
and <a class="western" href="#L813">8-13</a>,
can actually have quite
different performance characteristics.</font></font></p>

<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">Finally, we come to
the strangest part of the 8080 legacy, the <b>lahf</b> and

positions in the lower byte of the 8088's FLAGS register as they are
in the 8080's FLAGS register. <b>sahf</b> reverses the
action of
<b>lahf</b>, loading the 8080-compatible flags into the

<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">While it's a pretty
safe bet that nobody is writing code that uses <b>lahf</b>
and <b>sahf</b>
to emulate 8080 instructions anymore, there are nonetheless a few
interesting tricks to be played with these instructions. The key is
that <b>lahf</b> and <b>sahf</b> give us a
compact (1 byte) and fast
(4 cycles) way to save and load the flags we're generally most
interested in testing without disturbing the direction and interrupt
flags. (Note that the overflow flag also is not saved or restored by
these instructions.) By contrast, <b>pushf</b> and <b>popf</b>,
the
standard instructions for saving and restoring the flags, take 14 and
12 cycles, respectively, and affect all the flags. What's more, <b>lahf</b>
and <b>sahf</b>, unlike <b>pushf</b> and <b>popf</b>,
avoid the
potential complications of accessing the stack.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> All
in all, <b>lahf</b>
and <b>sahf</b> run faster and tend to cause fewer
complications than
<b>pushf</b> and <b>popf</b>. This means that
these instructions are
attractive whenever you generate a status but don't want to check it
right away. This is particularly true if you can't be sure the stack
pointer will point to the same place when you finally do check the
status, since <b>pushf</b> and <b>popf</b>
wouldn't work in such a
case.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> By
the way, <b>sahf</b>
is also useful for handling certain status flags of the 8087 numeric
coprocessor. The 8087's flags can't be tested directly; they must be
stored to memory by the 8087, then tested by the 8088. One good way
to do this for testing certain 8088 statuses, such as
greater-than/less-than results from comparisons, is by storing the
8087's flags to memory, loading AH from the stored flags, and
executing <b>sahf</b> to copy the flags into the 8088's
FLAGS
register, where they can be used to control conditional jumps.</font></font></p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">
<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">Let's look at <b>lahf</b>
and <b>sahf</b> in action. Suppose we have a loop in which
a value
stored in AL is added to each element of a byte array, with the loop
ending only when the result of any addition exceeds 7Fh, causing the
Sign flag to be set. Unfortunately, the array pointer must be
incremented after the addition, wiping out the Sign flag that we need
to test at the bottom of the loop, so we need some way to preserve
the Sign flag during execution of the instruction that increments the
array pointer.</font></font></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703"> <a class="western" href="#L814">Listing
8-14</a> solves this problem by using <b>pushf</b>
and <b>popf</b> to
preserve the Sign flag. The Zen timer reports that with this
approach it takes 16.45 ms to process 1000 array elements, or 16.45
us per element. Astoundingly, <a class="western" href="#L815">Listing
8-15</a>, which is exactly the same as <a class="western" href="#L814">Listing

45% improvement in <i>the whole loop</i>; the performance
advantage
of just <b>lahf</b> and <b>sahf</b> versus <b>pushf</b>

<font color="#110d06"><font color="#0b0703">Let's look at the code
in <a class="western" href="#L816">Listing 8-16</a>
for a moment
more, since it's often true that even heavily-optimized code will
yield a bit more performance with a bit of effort. What's looks
less-than-optimal about <a class="western" href="#L816">Listing
8-16</a>? <b>add</b> is pretty clearly
indispensible, as is <b>inc</b>. However, there are two
jumps inside the loop; if we could manage with
one jump, things should speed up a bit. With a bit of ingenuity, it
is indeed possible to get by with one jump, as shown in <a name="L817R"></a><a class="western" href="#L817">Listing

key to <a class="western" href="#L817">Listing

put the conditional jump at the bottom of the loop without the
necessity of preserving the flags for several instructions (as is
done in <a class="western" href="#L814">Listings

<a class="western" href="#L817">Listing 8-17</a>

trust what we measure, so let's compare actual performance.</font></font></p>

faster? To be
honest, I don't know. <a class="western" href="#L817">Listing
8-17</a>
probably wastes some prefetches at the bottom of the loop, where <b>add
[bx],al</b>, a slow, short instruction that allows the prefetch
queue
to fill, is followed by a jump that flushes the queue. There may
also be interaction between the memory operand accesses of the <b>add</b>
instruction and prefetching that works to the relative benefit of
<a class="western" href="#L816">Listing 8-16</a>.
There may be
synchronization with DRAM refresh taking place as well.</font></font></p>

in optimization are these: we created shorter, faster code by
examining a programming problem from a new perspective, and we
